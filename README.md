## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- TailwindCSS
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - Using the experimental app directory

### What I learned

This was my first time using the new app directory along side with React Server Components. At the beginning it was a bit confusing there is change in the mental model but after a while I got the hang of it. I also learned how to use the Free Dictionary API.

### Continued development

I would like to continue using the new app directory and learn more about React Server Components.

### Useful resources

- [Next.js Beta Docs](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/getting-started) - This helped me understanding the concept behind server components and how to use them.
